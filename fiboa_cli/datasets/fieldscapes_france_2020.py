DESCRIPTION = """The graphic parcel register is a geographical database used as a reference for the processing of aid from the common agricultural policy (CAP).

The anonymized version distributed here as part of the public service for making reference data available contains graphic data for plots (basic land unit for farmers' declaration) with their main crop. This data has been produced by the Services and Payment Agency (ASP) since 2007.

In accordance with technical instruction DGPE/SDGP/2022-106 relating to the dissemination and use of data from the Graphical Parcel Register (RPG) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Sovereignty, agricultural plots instructed within the framework of the common agricultural policy are publicly disseminated.

The anonymous RPG data are vintage and contain plots corresponding to those declared for campaign N in their known situation and decided by the administration, generally on January 1 of year N+1. These data cover the entire French territory, including Mayotte and Saint-Martin, but excluding Saint-BarthÃ©lemy."""

    Converts the field boundary datasets to fiboa.

    For reference, this is the order in which the conversion steps are applied:
    0. Read GeoDataFrame from file
    1. Run global migration (if provided through MIGRATION)
    2. Run filters to remove rows that shall not be in the final data
       (if provided through COLUMN_FILTERS)
    3. Add columns with constant values
    4. Run column migrations (if provided through COLUMN_MIGRATIONS)
    5. Duplicate columns (if an array is provided as the value in COLUMNS)
    6. Rename columns (as provided in COLUMNS)
    7. Remove columns (if column is not present as value in COLUMNS)
    8. Create the collection
    9. Change data types of the columns based on the provided schemas
    (fiboa spec, extensions, and MISSING_SCHEMAS)
    10. Write the data to the Parquet file

    Parameters:
    output_file (str): Path where the Parquet file shall be stored.
    cache): Path to a cached file of the data. Default: None.
                      Can be used to avoid repetitive downloads from the original data source.
    source_coop_url (str): URL to the (future) Source Cooperative repository. Default: None
    collection (bool): Additionally, store the collection separate from Parquet file. Default: False
    compression (str): Compression method for the Parquet file. Default: zstd
    kwargs: Additional keyword arguments for GeoPanda's read_file() or read_parquet() function.
