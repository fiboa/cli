DESCRIPTION = """BRP - Crop plots consists of the location of agricultural plots linked to the crop grown. The file is a selection of information from the Basic Register of Plots (BRP) of the Netherlands Enterprise Agency. The boundaries of the agricultural plots are based on the Agricultural Area of ​​the Netherlands (AAN).

The user of the plot must annually register his crop plots and indicate which crop is grown on the plot in question. A dataset is generated for each year with reference date May 15."""

    Converts the field boundary datasets to fiboa.

    For reference, this is the order in which the conversion steps are applied:
    0. Read GeoDataFrame from file
    1. Run global migration (if provided through MIGRATION)
    2. Run filters to remove rows that shall not be in the final data
       (if provided through COLUMN_FILTERS)
    3. Add columns with constant values
    4. Run column migrations (if provided through COLUMN_MIGRATIONS)
    5. Duplicate columns (if an array is provided as the value in COLUMNS)
    6. Rename columns (as provided in COLUMNS)
    7. Remove columns (if column is not present as value in COLUMNS)
    8. Create the collection
    9. Change data types of the columns based on the provided schemas
    (fiboa spec, extensions, and MISSING_SCHEMAS)
    10. Write the data to the Parquet file

    Parameters:
    output_file (str): Path where the Parquet file shall be stored.
    cache): Path to a cached file of the data. Default: None.
                      Can be used to avoid repetitive downloads from the original data source.
    source_coop_url (str): URL to the (future) Source Cooperative repository. Default: None
    collection (bool): Additionally, store the collection separate from Parquet file. Default: False
    compression (str): Compression method for the Parquet file. Default: zstd
    kwargs: Additional keyword arguments for GeoPanda's read_file() or read_parquet() function.
